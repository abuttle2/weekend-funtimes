# weekend-funtimes

## Description

### Who is the audience?

An events planning company that plans weekend events that are either outdoor
camping themed events or indoor movie binge watching themed events depending on the weather forecast for that weekend.

### Whatt is the problem the product will address?

We are solving the problem of not having access to a Weekend Funtimes
Planner. The Weekend Funtimes application will allow the events planning
company to determine what the theme of the weekend event will be depending on
the weather forecast so that they can plan accordingly.

Using the weather api to check the weather forecast for that weekend, they will be able to decide on having either a weekend of outdoor camping activities for good weather or a movie binge watching themed fun weekend for bad weather.

There will be the movie api to help select the various movies the guests want to watch and these will filter based on ratings inputted. We will also have the map api to help select good camping spots and these will filter based on user choices.
 
### How does the product solve that problem?

Based on user input, the data from the Weather API will generate the weather forecast for the upcoming weekend and inform the user as to whether they should plan for outdoor camping activities or indoor movie binge watching events. For the movies theme,we will also have an API of a list of movies that you can filter through based on ratings selected by the user.For the outdoor camping activities theme, we will have an API of a list of good camping locations that you can filter through based on user input.
 
As an events planning company
I WANT to know the weather forecast for any weekend and the option of generating additional info about movie options and camping locations to choose from 
SO THAT I can determine what theme the weekend funtime will be and plan
accordingly.
