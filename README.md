## Description

### Whatt is the problem the product will address?

We are solving the problem of not having access to a Weekend Funtimes
Planner. The Weekend Funtimes application will allow the events planning
company to determine what the theme of the weekend event will be depending on
the weather forecast so that they can plan accordingly.

Using the weather api to check the weather forecast for that weekend, they will be able to decide on having either a weekend of outdoor camping activities for good weather or a movie binge watching themed fun weekend for bad weather.

There will be the movie api to help select the various movies the guests want to watch and these will filter based on ratings inputted. We will also have the map api to help select good camping spots and these will filter based on user choices.

### Who is the audience?

An events planning company that plans weekend events that are either outdoor
camping themed events or indoor movie binge watching themed events depending on the weather forecast for that weekend.
